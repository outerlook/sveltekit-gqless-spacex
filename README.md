## Experimental example
This example was created to give example of working with gqless and svelte.
Windicss was added for convenience.

## Starting server
```bash
pnpm run dev
```


## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
